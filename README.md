The virtual experience programme is provided by Tata iQ or Tata Insights and Quants. I discover how passionate, multidisciplinary experts utilise data visualisation technologies like Tableau and Power BI to take on some of the most difficult business problems and uncover fascinating insights buried in the mountains of produced data.

The programme demonstrates the kind of issues dealt with by Tata Insights and Quants every day and makes an effort to imitate the difficulties an individual could have.

It's a good learning experience as I have gone through real time case study.

ðŸ”— There are total 4 Tasks. Each task has some unique challenge!!

ðŸ‘‰ In Task 1 we have to draft some questions. Those questions are supposed to be asked by company's CEO and CMO based on given datasets. So we have to think from the company's CEO and CMO's perspective and then draft the questions.

ðŸ‘‰ In Task 2 we get some objective questions related to data visualization software i.e. Power BI.

ðŸ‘‰ In Task 3 we are given 4 Requirements and based on those we have to create 4 visuals on different tabs either using Power BI or Tableau.

ðŸ‘‰ In Task 4 we have to create a presentation, a screen recording, delivering the analyzation that we have done on the basis of the company's CEO and CMO'S requirements.
