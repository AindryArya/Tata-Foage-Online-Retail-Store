# Tata-Forage-Online-Retail-Store'

The virtual experience programme is provided by Tata iQ or Tata Insights and Quants. I discover how passionate, multidisciplinary experts utilise data visualisation technologies like Tableau and Power BI to take on some of the most difficult business problems and uncover fascinating insights buried in the mountains of produced data.

The programme demonstrates the kind of issues dealt with by Tata Insights and Quants every day and makes an effort to imitate the difficulties an individual could have.

It's a good learning experience as I have gone through real time case study.

ðŸ”— There are total 4 Tasks. Each task has some unique challenge!!

ðŸ‘‰ In Task 1 we have to draft some questions. Those questions are supposed to be asked by company's CEO and CMO based on given datasets. So we have to think from the company's CEO and CMO's perspective and then draft the questions.

ðŸ‘‰ In Task 2 we get some objective questions related to data visualization software i.e. Power BI.

ðŸ‘‰ In Task 3 we are given 4 Requirements and based on those we have to create 4 visuals on different tabs either using Power BI or Tableau.

ðŸ‘‰ In Task 4 we have to create a presentation, a screen recording, delivering the analyzation that we have done on the basis of the company's CEO and CMO'S requirements.



After Solving, Here are the 4 Requirements that the Company's CEO and CMO wanted to know which are:

Question 1 

The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only.He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.


Question 2

The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

Question 3

The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

Question 4

The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.



****Make Sure to Clean the data before solving their Concern***

Data Cleaning Steps performed:
1) Changing to correct Data Type.
2) Removing any Null, Blank or Duplicate values.
3) Quantity should not be below 1 unit.
4) Unit price should not be below $0.
